A Python-based 2D car racing game built using Pygame, demonstrating fundamental computer graphics transformations such as translation, boundary checking, and collision detection. This educational project simulates a race track where the player controls a car, dodges enemy vehicles, and scores points.

🎯 Features
🛣️ 3-lane race track with animated lane markers

🚘 Player car control using arrow keys

🚧 Random enemy car spawning

💥 Collision detection with crash animation

⏱️ Score tracking and increasing difficulty

🔁 Restart or exit on game over

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.11

Pygame

OOP principles (Classes for Vehicle, PlayerVehicle)

PNG image assets for cars and visuals

📚 Learning Objectives
Understand and implement 2D transformations

Handle real-time user input and sprite rendering

Apply basic game loop logic and object collision
